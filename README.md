# bandparameters
Here lies basically everything I've written so far (03-20-25) to do my statistical analysis. Here's an exerpt from the introduction of my report to provide some context: "This report explores the surface heterogeneity on Asteroid (101955) Bennu through an exploration of the emissivity spectra collected by the OSIRIS-REx Thermal Emission Spectrometer (OTES) for each of the four prospective sampling sites: Nightingale, Osprey, Sandpiper, and Kingfisher. Key spectral features were identified and used as band parameters to perform multiple statistical correlations, in order to determine the spread, variety, and similarity of the four sites in Mid Infrared (MIR)." The code included here uses PCA, KNN, ANOVA, and Band Rationing. For more information, hit me up: emma.belhadfa@physics.ox.ac.uk
